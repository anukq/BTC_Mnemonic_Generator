# BTC Mnemonic Generator
This is a Bitcoin Mnemonic Generator, it generates a 24 words phrase for a Bitcoin wallet address. This script will only generate english word phrases.

I have a compiled .exe made with PyInstaller for Windows that you can download from this link: 

https://github.com/ils94/BTC_Mnemonic_Generator/releases/download/release/BTCMG.zip

Do not download this compiled executable from anywhere else but from this repository! I'm not responsible if you download it from somewhere else and get your Bitcoin stolen in the future because someone made a malicious version of this .exe! The code of this generator will always remain open source!

If you do not trust my compiled .exe, but still want to use this, here what you have to do:

Download Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download both BTCMG.py, generator.py and the wordlist folder from this repository

Put both BTCMG.py, generator.py and wordlist folder all in the same folder on your computer

Install Python from the link above, find python.exe on your computer or open Window's CMD and type python path/to/BTCMG.py and hit enter.

You can also click and drag BTCMG.py into python.exe to open the program (but remember that generator.py and the wordlist folder must be in the same folder as BTCMG.py!)

(ALWAYS DOWNLOAD PYTHON FROM https://www.python.org/downloads/ ! Do not trust other sources!)
